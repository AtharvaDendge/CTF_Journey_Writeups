# 🏴‍☠️ CTF Writeups by Atharva Dendge

Welcome to my **CTF Writeups Repository** 🚀  
Here I document my journey through Capture The Flag challenges on platforms like **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, and CTF competitions.  

Each writeup is structured to showcase **real-world attack methodology** — including **enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and key takeaways**.  
This not only reflects my problem-solving skills but also demonstrates practical offensive security techniques.

3. **Privilege Escalation** → Gaining higher-level access  
4. **Flag Capture** → Final objective  
5. **Key Takeaways** → What I learned
