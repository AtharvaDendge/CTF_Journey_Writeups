## 🕵️ Task 1: Introduction

The internet is flooded with information. As security professionals we must search smartly, not blindly.

Focus areas:

* Evaluate credibility of sources

* Use search engines efficiently

* Explore specialized OSINT search engines

* Read technical documentation

* Utilize social media & news outlets

* Example: Google search for “learn hacking” returns ~1.5 billion results.

✅ No answers required here.

## 🧩 Task 2: Evaluation of Search Results

When evaluating online info:

Source → Author/organization credibility

Evidence & Reasoning → Look for factual, logical claims

Objectivity & Bias → Avoid agenda-driven posts

Corroboration & Consistency → Cross-check with other trusted sources

#### Q & A

Q: What do you call a cryptographic method or product considered bogus or fraudulent?

```Snake oil```

Q: What is the name of the command replacing netstat in Linux?

```ss```

## 🔎 Task 3: Search Engines & Operators

#### Key Google operators:

Operator	Purpose	Example
" "	Exact phrase search	"passive reconnaissance"
site:	Limit to a specific domain	site:tryhackme.com success
-	Exclude a term	pyramids -tourism
filetype:	Find documents of a specific type	filetype:ppt cyber security

#### Q & A

Q: Limit Google search to PDF files containing “cyber warfare report”

```filetype:pdf cyber warfare report```

Q: The Linux command ss stands for

```socket statistics```

## 🌐 Task 4: Specialized Search Engines

Famous OSINT engines:

Shodan → Finds internet-connected devices

Censys → Discovers hosts, domains, certificates

VirusTotal → Scans files/URLs with 60+ AV engines

Have I Been Pwned → Checks if email appeared in breaches

#### Q & A

Q: Top country with lighttpd servers

```United States```

Q: BitDefenderFalx detects file with given hash as

```Android.Riskware.Agent.LHH```

## ⚙️ Task 5: Vulnerabilities & Exploits

CVE → Unique ID for each vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2014-0160 = Heartbleed).

Exploit-DB → Exploit & PoC code repository.

GitHub → Hosts PoCs, research tools, scripts.

#### Q & A

Q: CVE-2024-3094 refers to

```xz```

## 📄 Task 6: Technical Documentation

Always prefer official docs:

Linux man pages:
man ip → press q to quit

Windows Docs:
Search ipconfig in Microsoft Docs

Product Docs:
(e.g., Snort, Apache HTTPD, PHP, Node.js)

#### Q & A

Q: The Linux command cat stands for

```concatenate```

Q: Netstat parameter in Windows showing executable for each connection

```-b```

## 📱 Task 7: Social Media & News

OSINT sources also include:

LinkedIn / Twitter / Facebook → Find technical background & overshared personal info

Cybersecurity News Sites → e.g., The Hacker News, BleepingComputer, DarkReading

#### Q & A

Q: Popular social media to learn technical background of employees

```LinkedIn```

Q: Platform to find personal info like childhood school

```Facebook```

## 🏁 Task 8: Conclusion

We explored the essential OSINT skills:

Effective searching and filtering

Validating source credibility

Leveraging specialized engines & official docs

Staying updated via social media & news outlets

By consistently applying these techniques, a cybersecurity professional can efficiently discover reliable, actionable intelligence.
